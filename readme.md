## Documentation

Head to the [Overview](https://screencloud.github.io/developer/overview) for a quick intro to some key concepts, or go straight to [Get Started](https://screencloud.github.io/developer/get-started).

This is still early days for our 3rd party app support. Some steps are more manual than we'd like, but we'll call them out clearly and wherever we can help, we're happy to.

We'd really appreciate [your feedback](<(https://github.com/screencloud/developer/issues)>) on what's painful or confusing so we know where to focus our efforts next.
