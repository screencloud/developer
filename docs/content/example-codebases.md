Our sample apps are all hosted in the [Github repo](https://github.com/screencloud/developer). They're free to use, either to learn from or to copy and paste as the starting point for your own apps.

For any issues or questions, please contact our [Professional Services team](proservices@screencloud.io).

## JavaScript Sample App

[https://github.com/screencloud/developer/tree/master/examples/javascript-app](https://github.com/screencloud/developer/tree/master/examples/javascript-app)

- Connects to the Player and reads a `config` value
- Supports preloading by fetching the first joke in advance, but not refreshing jokes until the app is visible on screen.

To use:

```
npm install
npm start
```
