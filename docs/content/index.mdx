Welcome! So you'd like to build your own apps and connect your own products to screens?

Awesome, we'd love to see them!

Head to the Overview (LINK) for a quick intro to some key concepts, or go straight to Get Started (LINK).

You can use the [Github Issues](https://github.com/screencloud/developer/issues) to raise a question to our devs any time, or contact [our Support team](https://screen.cloud/contact) if the inquiry is confidential.

PS - This is still early days for our 3rd party app support. Some steps are more manual than we'd like, but we'll call them out clearly and wherever we can help, we're happy to.

We'd really appreciate [your feedback](https://github.com/screencloud/developer/issues) on what's painful or confusing so we know where to focus our efforts next.
